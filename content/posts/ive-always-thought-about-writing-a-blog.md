It's been just a bit over 10 years since I started programming for real.

There were a number of times when I was 10 or 11 where I tried to learn through Codecademy or - one of my favourite memories - by copying my friend's PHP IRC bot character by character over Skype screen share at 2am... But it wasn't until year 11 of school in 2015 when I started my first real project and truly began learning to program for real.

Since then, I've had several [personal projects](/projects), studied at university - home and abroad, travelled overseas, climbed the corporate ladder, lead teams of engineers, volunteered at events, started a business, started home labbing, dabbled in a multitude of other areas and had countless experiences that have left me in the moment wishing I had somewhere to empty my thoughts onto the metaphorical paper. Which brings us here!

I don't intend to put expectations on myself of how often I'll write or what I'll write about, if at all! Who knows, I might finish writing this post and decide "you know what, this isn't for me!".

I'll _probably_ write predominantly about software, but I'm always doing new things so I'm sure I'll get inspired by something unexpected. Either way, I'll leave that for future me to decide.

I hope someday I'll need to scroll to the bottom of a long page to find this post and see it was the start of something worth pursuing.
