My personal projects are where I started with programming and while almost all of my time these days goes into my full time software engineering job and my consulting business, I still love working on personal projects when I get the time.

This is a brief history of the projects notable enough for me to mention for one reason or another.
I made some for myself, some to learn a new skill, and some to fill a community need.

Projects are dated by when I started working on them, usually based on git history, or my best guess for the older ones!
