My first step into web development.
{{< /lead >}}

syrsite was my first web project, and the original inhabitant of https://syrin.me, now relegated to https://old.syrin.me.

I was comfortable using python at this point so I followed along [sentdex's django tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNQxxpM1yOs) all the way from setting up [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), to styling with [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) v3 to eventually deploying to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) where I would start learning linux for the first time.

There was nothing else to the base of syrsite, just a few static pages. However it would shortly after become the home of both [osu!chan classic](../osuchan-classic/index.md) and [pp+](../pp+/index.md).
