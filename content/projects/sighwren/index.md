sighwren is my personal blog; the site you're (probably) reading this on!

sighwren is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme.

Technically there is nothing special really going on here. It's a very stock standard implementation that is only made special, at least I hope, by it's content.

The only truly notable thing about it so far is how long it took from `git init` to [publishing](../../posts/ive-always-thought-about-writing-a-blog.md)! Over a year! Though this was largely due to me wanting to design a logo and needing to learn [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) from scratch and getting busy a lot in the process, which took a while, but I'm happy with the results.
